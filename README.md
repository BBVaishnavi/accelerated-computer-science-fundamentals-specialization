# Accelerated-Computer-Science-Fundamentals Specialization ([Link](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/cs-fundamentals))

This repository contains my programming assignments for the specialization. \\

Topics covered by this Specialization include basic object-oriented programming, the analysis of asymptotic algorithmic run times, and the implementation of basic data structures including arrays, hash tables, linked lists, trees, heaps and graphs, as well as algorithms for traversals, rebalancing and shortest paths.
